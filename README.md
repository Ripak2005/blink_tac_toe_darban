## 🧰 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React.js
- 🎨 CSS (custom styling and responsive layout)
- 🔊 use-sound (for win sound effects)
- 🎉 react-confetti (for confetti animation)
- 📦 Deployed on Vercel

## 😎 Emoji Categories

Each player chooses one of the following categories before the game starts:

- **Animals**: 🐶 🐱 🐵 🐰
- **Food**: 🍕 🍟 🍔 🍩
- **Sports**: ⚽ 🏀 🏈 🎾

On each turn, a random emoji from the selected category is assigned to the player.

## 💨 Vanishing Feature (FIFO Logic)

To keep the board dynamic:

- Players can only have **3 active emojis** on the board at any time.
- When a **4th emoji** is placed:
  - The **oldest emoji disappears** automatically using **FIFO (First In, First Out)** logic.
  - The player **cannot place the new emoji on the vanished spot** immediately.
  - The cell becomes **empty and available** for future moves.

This rule forces strategy and memory, adding a unique twist to classic Tic Tac Toe.
